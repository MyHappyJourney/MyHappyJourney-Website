We arrange hotels with lifts/ground-floor access for senior citizens, and safe, engaging activities like tea garden walks, gentle boating, and elephant interactions for kids."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "Will the cab be exclusively private for our family?",
    answer: "Yes, 100% private. You get a dedicated, sanitized AC vehicle (Sedan, Innova Crysta, or Tempo Traveller depending on your family size) along with a verified, experienced chauffeur who stays with your family for all transfers, sightseeing, and shopping from arrival to departure."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "Can we request child-friendly, non-spicy, or Pure Veg / Jain meals?",
    answer: "Certainly! Daily breakfast is included at all family-friendly resorts with wide buffet selections (South Indian, North Indian, continental). On your private Alleppey houseboat, our onboard chef custom-cooks fresh meals tailored to your family's exact taste — including non-spicy kid meals, pure vegetarian, and Jain preparations."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "Is the Alleppey houseboat safe and private for families?",
    answer: "Yes. We only book 100% private deluxe/luxury houseboats (no strangers sharing). Each houseboat features air-conditioned bedrooms with attached modern bathrooms, safety railings, life jackets, and a licensed, family-friendly 3-member crew (captain, chef, engine driver)."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-5",
    question: "Can we book interconnected rooms or extra beds for our children?",
    answer: "Yes! When planning your itinerary, our family travel expert can arrange interconnected rooms, adjoining family suites, or rollaway extra mattresses/cots depending on your children's ages and preferences."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-6",
    question: "What support do you provide during our family trip?",
    answer: "You receive a dedicated 24×7 Kerala Relationship Manager available via direct call and WhatsApp throughout your trip, in addition to your local chauffeur. We continuously coordinate hotel check-ins, boat boarding, and any on-the-spot adjustments you need."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-7",
    question: "Can we customize sightseeing or add more leisure time for kids to relax?",
    answer: "Yes, our packages are 100% flexible. Because your cab and driver are private, you set the daily pace. If your children or parents wish to sleep in, relax by the resort swimming pool, or skip a sightseeing spot, you can modify the daily schedule on the go."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-8",
    question: "How do airport pickups and drops work for families?",
    answer: "Your chauffeur will be waiting inside the arrival gate of Cochin (COK) or Trivandrum (TRV) airport holding a name placard for your family. He assists with all your luggage and welcomes you with chilled mineral water to start your stress-free holiday."
