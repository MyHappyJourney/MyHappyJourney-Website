export const FAQS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    id: "faq-1",
    question: "Is this Kerala tour package suitable for senior citizens with mobility concerns or knee pain?",
    answer: "Yes, 100%! We design our senior citizen tours with relaxed pacing, minimal walking, and step-free convenience. All hotels are vetted for lift (elevator) access or priority ground-floor rooms with western attached bathrooms. Sightseeing spots are chosen where cabs can drop you close to viewpoints, and wheelchair assistance can be arranged on request at major attractions."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    question: "How do you ensure comfortable and safe travel on Kerala's hill roads (e.g. Munnar)?",
    answer: "Our drivers are specially trained for senior citizens. They drive at a gentle, smooth pace without sharp turns or abrupt braking to prevent motion sickness. We provide spacious, comfortable AC vehicles (like Innova Crysta or comfortable sedans) and schedule frequent rest, tea, and hygienic restroom breaks every 1.5 to 2 hours."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    question: "Can we request mild, diabetic-friendly, or Pure Vegetarian / Jain food?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We understand that senior travelers often require light, non-spicy, low-oil, or specific dietary preparations. Daily buffet breakfasts at all partner resorts offer hot South & North Indian options. On your private Alleppey houseboat, the onboard chef will customize each meal according to your exact preferences — including Jain, no onion/garlic, diabetic-friendly, or mild homestyle food."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-4",
    question: "How flexible is the daily itinerary? Can we take afternoon rest and start late?",
    answer: "Because you have a 100% private cab and chauffeur dedicated exclusively to you, the daily schedule runs entirely at your comfort. There is zero rush. You can wake up late, start after a relaxed breakfast, take an afternoon nap at the resort, or skip any spot whenever you feel tired."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-5",
    question: "What medical assistance and emergency support do you provide during the tour?",
    answer: "Your safety and well-being are our highest priority. Every vehicle is equipped with a basic first-aid kit. Furthermore, our dedicated 24×7 Senior-Care Travel Manager and local chauffeurs are familiar with leading hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in Cochin, Munnar, Thekkady, Alleppey, and Trivandrum to assist immediately if any medical need arises."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-6",
    question: "Can sons/daughters book this Kerala tour for their elderly parents living in India?",
    answer: "Yes! Over 60% of our senior tours are booked by loving children (including NRIs across USA, UK, UAE, and Singapore) for their parents. We provide complete doorstep-to-doorstep care: our driver receives your parents at the airport with a name placard, carries their luggage, assists with check-ins, and our support team sends regular WhatsApp updates and photos to you throughout their trip."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-7",
    question: "How accessible and comfortable is the private Alleppey houseboat for seniors?",
    answer: "We select premium, stable houseboats with safe, wide boarding planks and crew assistance. All bedrooms are situated on the lower deck with ground-level access, air-conditioning, and modern attached western toilets. The gentle, silent cruise through calm waters is exceptionally soothing and relaxing for elderly guests."
  },
  {
    id: "faq-8",
    question: "Can we include sacred temple visits like Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple or Guruvayur?",
    answer: "Yes! Pilgrimage and spiritual darshans are a favorite among senior travelers. We coordinate temple visits according to convenient auspicious timings, advise on dress codes, and guide on senior-citizen queue facilities or battery-car/wheelchair availability to ensure a peaceful, blessed darshan."
